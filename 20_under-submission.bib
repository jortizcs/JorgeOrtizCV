  abstract  = {In current multimodal tasks, models typically freeze the encoder and decoder while adapting intermediate layers to task-specific goals, such as region captioning. Region-level visual understanding presents significant challenges for large-scale vision-language models. While limited spatial awareness is a known issue, coarse-grained pretraining exacerbates the difficulty of optimizing latent representations for effective encoder-decoder alignment. We propose AlignCap, a framework designed to enhance region-level understanding through fine-grained alignment of latent spaces. Our approach introduces a novel latent feature refinement module and a semantic space alignment module, incorporating contrastive learning to enhance region-level captioning performance. A General Object Detection (GOD) method is employed as a data preprocessing pipeline to address spatial limitations. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in region-level captioning across tasks.},

  abstract  = {As urban populations grow, cities are deploying interconnected sensing systems to realize smart cities' vision. Streetscape applications—focusing on pedestrian safety and adaptive traffic management—depend on managing distributed, heterogeneous sensor data. SASS addresses these challenges through multimodal data synchronization, spatiotemporal data fusion, and distributed edge computing. Evaluations in real-world testbeds show SASS reduces temporal misalignment errors by 88% and improves detection accuracy by over 10%. Results demonstrate SASS's potential to support scalable, real-time urban sensing applications.},

  abstract  = {Urban environments pose significant challenges to pedestrian safety and mobility. This paper introduces the Streetscape Application Services Stack (SASS), a novel sensing framework for developing real-time, multimodal streetscape applications in smart cities. Streetscapes are holistic urban environments encompassing roads, buildings, and public spaces. Our framework integrates diverse sensing modalities, including overhead cameras, mobile IMU sensors, medical-grade wearables, and edge computing units, to enable hyper-local sensing and responsive applications. SASS supports functionalities such as multimodal pedestrian tracking, blind pedestrian navigation, and extended cross-walk times for mobility-impaired pedestrians. The framework includes a gesture-based synchronization module that matches features across sensor modalities, eliminating the need for traditional time synchronization methods. A pedestrian and vehicle detection module also leverages multi-camera detection for enhanced accuracy and coverage. We evaluate our framework’s performance in various urban sensing scenarios, demonstrating an 85\% reduction in synchronization error and over 10\% improvement in pedestrian and vehicle detection accuracy. Our results demonstrate significant potential for enhancing pedestrian safety and mobility in smart cities.},

  abstract  = {Complex human activity recognition (CHAR) remains a pivotal challenge within ubiquitous computing, especially in the context of smart environments. Existing studies typically require meticulous labeling of both atomic and complex activities, a task that is labor-intensive and prone to errors due to the scarcity and inaccuracies of available datasets. Most prior research has focused on datasets that either precisely label atomic activities or, at minimum, their sequence—approaches that are often impractical in real-world settings. In response, we introduce GeXSe (Generative Explanatory Sensor System), a novel framework that treats the outputs of atomic activities as a distribution over specified intervals. Leveraging generative methodologies, GeXSe elucidates the reasoning behind activity classifications through video-based explanations, accessible to users without prior machine learning expertise. Our evaluation across three publicly available datasets demonstrates that GeXSe enhances the accuracy of complex activity recognition without necessitating precise temporal or sequential labeling of atomic activities. Furthermore, user studies confirm that GeXSe’s explanations are more intelligible compared to existing methods, facilitating a broader understanding of complex activity recognition among non-experts.},
